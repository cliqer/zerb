The sequencing of the human genome, and advances in molecular biology, have illuminated the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases and have propelled our knowledge of how the brain controls behavior.\n\nTo grasp the wider implications of these developments and gain a fundamental understanding of this dynamic, fast-moving field, Principles of Neuroscience stands alone as the most authoritative and indispensible resource of its kind.\n\nIn this classic text, prominent researchers in the field expertly survey the entire spectrum of neural science, giving an up-to-date, unparalleled view of the discipline for anyone who studies brain and mind. Here, in one remarkable volume, is the current state of neural science knowledge—ranging from molecules and cells, to anatomic structures and systems, to the senses and cognitive functions—all supported by more than 900 precise, full-color illustrations. In addition to clarifying complex topics, the book also benefits from a cohesive organization, beginning with an insightful overview of the interrelationships between the brain, nervous system, genes, and behavior. Principles of Neural Science then proceeds with an in-depth examination of the molecular and cellular biology of nerve cells, synaptic transmission, and the neural basis of cognition. The remaining sections illuminate how cells, molecules, and systems give us sight, hearing, touch, movement, thought, learning, memories, and emotions.\n\nThe new fifth edition of Principles of Neural Science is thoroughly updated to reflect the tremendous amount of research, and the very latest clinical perspectives, that have significantly transformed the field within the last decade.\n\nUltimately, Principles of Neural Science affirms that all behavior is an expression of neural activity, and that the future of clinical neurology and psychiatry hinges on the progress of neural science. Far exceeding the scope and scholarship of similar texts, this unmatched guide offers a commanding, scientifically rigorous perspective on the molecular mechanisms of neural function and disease—one that you’ll continually rely on to advance your comprehension of brain, mind, and behavior.", "edition" : 5, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-13T09:30:09.173+0000" }, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-26T06:17:48.839+0000" }, "__v" : 0, "id" : "5d0217a1864c4810b34463e3", "publisher" : { "$oid" : "5d00faeed92c8c23103fd61c" }, "format" : "Hardcover", "isbn" : "9780071390118" },

It is certainly useful for those undertaking thyroid related research but it is clearly far too detailed for students other than those undertaking basic science research in the thyroid. This edition has added the surgical management of thyroid disorders which is clearly an asset for the endocrine surgeon. With this type of reference text it is inevitable that there will be information from many years ago cited. There has however been a clear effort to update information and expand detail including more up-to-date references — studies related to markers of disease progression in thyroid cancer, cytopathology of thyroid cancer. Studies and other works that are references are of high quality and in general integral to the subject matter being discussed. There has also been a clear effort made to critically appraise the texts being cited. In general it is well written. Sections of the book can be a little monotonous only due to the subject matter i.e. thyroid hormone synthesis and thyroglobulin structure, function and biosynthesis. The diagrams and illustrations particularly in the basic science section are very useful. The use of colour images would have made them a lot more pleasing on the eye. Only for those subspecializing in thyroid disorders or conducting research into the thyroid gland. This book has helped me to understand the thyroid gland further and will continue to do so.

Written in a clear, concise style, this unique text offers a concise overview of fundamental neuroanatomy and the clinical localization principles necessary to diagnose and treat patients with neurologic diseases and disorders.  Unlike other neurology textbooks that either focus on neuroanatomy or clinical neurology, Clinical Neurology and Neuroanatomy integrates the two in manner which simulates the way neurologists learn, teach, and think.\n\nClinical Neurology and Neuroanatomy is divided into two main sections. In Part 1, clinically relevant neuroanatomy is presented in clinical context in order to provide a framework for neurologic localization and differential diagnosis. The diseases mentioned in localization-based discussions of differential diagnosis in Part 1 are then discussed in clinical detail with respect to their diagnosis and management in Part 2.  Part 1 can therefore be consulted for a neuroanatomical localization-based approach to symptom evaluation, and Part 2 for the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of neurologic diseases.\n\nFEATURES\n• A clear, concise approach to explaining the complex relationship between neuroanatomical structure and function and neurologic disease\n• Numerous full-color illustrations and high resolution MRI and CT scans\n• Explanatory tables outline the clinical features, characteristics, and differential diagnosis of neurologic diseases and disorders ", "edition" : 1, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-14T06:30:07.616+0000" }, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-26T06:17:48.839+0000" }, "__v" : 0, "id" : "5d033eef864c4810b34464de", "publisher" : { "$oid" : "5d00faeed92c8c23103fd61c" }, "format" : "Hardcover" },

The emphasis throughout is on surgical treatment in the context of\nmodern interdisciplinary care.\nIt is said to be \"ideal for surgical residents, medical students facing a\nsurgical/oncology rotation, and practicing surgeons.\" Trainees will appreciate\nthe organization by tumors/sites and the concise algorithm-rich presentation.\nPracticing surgeons will find it an excellent compact reference for uncommon\nmalignancies. This is clearly a labor of love for the fellows, and the\nauthority of their faculty coauthors is undeniable.\nThe book consists of 20 site/tumor-specific chapters and five final chapters on\nspecial problems (such as \"Surgical Emergencies in Cancer Patients,\" and\n\"Cancer of Unknown Primary Site\"). The book leads off with two\nchapters on Breast - Non-invasive and Invasive tumors. The electronic version\nessentially duplicates the print version, but incorporates the usual robust\nsearch functions characteristic of such formats and allows portability.\nThere is no comparable title. Surgeons and trainees wanting a concise book that\ncovers common and rare malignancies will find this new edition lives up to the\npromise of the first edition.”\nWeighted Numerical Score: 86 - 3 Stars\nDoodys Publishers' Club, June 2018", "edition" : 6, "createdAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-14T11:56:04.340+0000" }, "updatedAt" : { "$date" : "2019-06-14T11:56:32.357+0000" }, "__v" : 0, "id" : "5d038b54864c4810b3446587", "publisher" : { "$oid" : "5d00fb23d92c8c23103fd61d" } },

A multitude of factors impinge on healthcare delivery today, including an ageing population, more sophisticated medicines, high patient expectation and changing health service infrastructure. Time demands on primary care doctors have caused other models of service delivery to be adopted across the world, leading to ongoing changes in the traditional boundaries of care between doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. Certain medical tasks are now being performed by nurses and pharmacists, for example prescribing. Healthcare policies to encourage patients to manage their own health have led to more medicines becoming available over the counter, allowing community pharmacists to manage and treat a wide range of conditions. Further deregulation of medicines to treat acute illness from different therapeutic areas seems likely. Government policy now encourages chronic disease management as a self-care activity, and could well be the largest area for future growth of reclassification of medicines.
